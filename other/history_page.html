            <p class="body_txt">In the beginning there was nothing, and out of nothing, an egg was born. From this egg was born Arceus "the original being".He then decided to create matter. Arceus therefore created two creatures Dialga and Palkia respectively responsible for time and space. Nevertheless, by creating matter, Arceus spawned the appearance of "antimatter" represented by Giratina. Arceus decided to banish Giratina to "the distortion world" because of her excessive violence. The creation of matter allowed Arceus to obtain a concrete form. This "gave form to nothingness". These are the Zarbi Pokémon capable of navigating between dimensions. Arceus then creates an egg. From this egg were born the three beings of the spirit, Créhelf for knowledge, Créfollet for emotion and Créfadet for will.</p>

            <p class="body_txt">Following the appearance of matter, it began to gain density and create a large amount of energy which became luminous. From this light a new entity was born, Ultra-Necrozma. Ultra-Necrozma spread its light across the entire universe until it ran out of energy and lost its Ultra-Necrozma form to a darker form, releasing stardust. He regained his Ultra-Necrozma form by absorbing light and the cycle continued. But the stardust it releases as it loses its Ultra form accumulates and creates a nebula. From the creation of the nebulae, a small species of Pokémon was born, Cosmog. When it absorbs stardust, it evolves into Cosmovum and by accumulating light it evolves again, either into Solgaléo or Lunala. In the same way that Cosmog is born and evolves planets are formed and among them, the Earth.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p class="body_txt">After the appearance of the Earth, Arceus created three titans in order to model it, Groudon for the lithosphere, Kyogre for the aquasphere and Rayquaza for the atmosphere. But where Groudon wanted to extend the lands Kyogre wanted to extend the seas. This is how a conflict broke out between the two titans. Rayquaza once he finished shaping the atmosphere intervened in the conflict between the two titans and calmed them down. Kyogre and Groudon, exhausted by their long fight, fell into a long sleep, leaving the Earth to go wrong, no longer having an entity to regulate the climate. Arceus then created the three birds of the climate, Electhor, Sulfura and Artickodin.<br><br><br></p>

            <p class="body_txt">Once the climate was regulated, Arceus created two guardians, Lugia for the night and Ho-oh for the day. He then created the notion of life with Xerneas, that of death with Yveltal and Zygarde responsible for maintaining the balance. Once these notions created Arceus created Mew, the ancestor of the majority of Pokémon knew, and let them develop. Arceus also created other mythical creatures to bring balance to his new world, a dragon symbolizing harmony, two little kings to master the oceans, Manaphy and Phione, a genie of wishes, Jirachie, a time traveler, Celebi, a space traveler, Hoopa, and a genius of victory Victini. He also created the Dream Dimension with Darkrai and Creselia. Arceus then created humans and in order to bring them faith and knowledge Arceus created Latias and Latios his messengers. This is how men learned of the existence of Arceus and the Matter Trio.</p>

The shock of this meteorite was so powerful that it awakened Kyogre and Groudon from their millennial slumber. Once awake the two titans resumed their conflict in front of humans and Pokémon totally powerless in front of the two titans they had just met. Rayquaza challenged by this meteorite wasted no time in descending to Earth and again stopping the titans in their destructive madness before returning to the sky. Not far from the place where the meteorite had crashed, a village of dracologists who had witnessed the scene decided to settle at the place where the meteor had crashed and to worship Rayquaza. This is how the meteor people were born.</p>

            <p class="body_txt">After the fight between Groudon and Kyogre, some civilizations saw Rayquaza's intervention as divine intervention and built a huge golem in Arceus' honor to thank him. Arceus touched by this gesture decided to give life to the golem. This is how Regigigas was born. Its mission was to help men in their development. A few years later, Regigigas met Sylveroy, a pokemon capable, among other things, of seeing the future. He then predicts the obstacles that men will encounter in their development. To allow men to successfully overcome these obstacles, Regigigas created 5 golems at different times in history to support him in his mission, Regirock the stone golem, Regice the ice golem, Registeel the steel golem, Regieleki the electric golem and Regidrago the golem draconic.</p>

It was a Solgaléo and a Lunala. Tokorico the guardian of Mele-Mele, Tokopiyon the guardian of Akala, Tokotoro the guardian of Ula-Ula and Tokopisco the guardian of Poni took them for a threat and decided to oppose them. Solgaléo and Lunala, admiring the bravery and power of the guardians, decided to help the archipelago to develop to such an extent that the local populations began to worship them. At the same time in the Ultra-dimension, a dimension other than ours in which the Ultra-Chimeras, the Ultra-Commando and Necrozma reside, the Ultra-Commando a group of humans who have always lived in the Ultra- dimension captured Necrozma to make it the source of light for their city the Ultra-Megapolis.<br><br><br></p>

But this escape cost Necrozma a large part of his energy, his body as well as his Ultra form. When he arrived in our world he crashed in Alola and with him his energy in the form of crystals and the pieces of his body which scattered all over Alola. Necrozma injured and seeking to regain his light he therefore attacked Solgaléo and managed to merge with him. Faced with this spectacle, the kings of the islands accompanied by the guardians decided to unite in order to free Solgaleo from the grip of Necrozma. During the fight the energy crystals and the pieces of Necrozma's body that he had lost reacted to the connection between the guardians and the kings thus giving them a whole new strength which allowed them to separate Solgaleo from Necrozma. They had just used the Z force for the first time. So they collected the crystals and the pieces of Necrozma to make Z bracelets and Z crystals. But each of the kings wanted this force for himself, so a war broke out. between the 4 islands. The guardians fought alongside their respective kings but their newly acquired power was so great and the damage caused by it so great that they decided to abandon their king and protect their island away from humans. Necrozma defeated meanwhile and more weakened than ever gone into hiding and we do not see him again for thousands of years.</p>

The meteorite meanwhile sank little by little into the ground of Galar over the years until it fell into oblivion. The energy contained in this meteorite animated clay dolls created by men.

This is how they turned against men. Because of their power, they decimated men. So the men united in order to stop them in their madness. Thus they managed to seal them in caves and peace returned.

            <p class="body_txt">After accumulating energy for 17,000 years, a super-powerful pokemon emerged from the meteorite that crashed into Galar thousands of years earlier. This pokemon was Ethernatos. But Sylveroy had predicted its arrival and knew how much of a threat this pokemon was. He therefore left to fight him but could not get the upper hand on the extra-terrestrial creature. Ethernatos was therefore able to leave the Galar underground and began to ravage it. Its energy was so powerful that it made pokemon that were too exposed to it grow and made them go into a destructive madness. This is what would later be called the Dynamax or Gigantamax phenomenon. It was then that two hero brothers, AZ and Harmonia, intervened accompanied by two legendary wolves, Zacian and Zamazenta. Together they managed to defeat Ethernatos and bring peace to Galar. Ethernatos then fell back into a deep sleep and parts of his body scattered all over Galar. They will be used by men to be able to use the Dynamax and Gigantamax phenomenon. But Zacian and Zamazenta having been in contact with the energy of Ethernatos for too long began to descend into madness. In agreement with his brother, AZ used his mysterious power which allowed him to turn the two pokemon into stone.</p>

            <p class="body_txt">Deprived of its little king Sylveroy, the lands of Galar ravaged by Ethernatos, was almost no longer fertile. AZ and Harmonia, recently crowned king following their victory over Ethernatos, decide to find other lands to settle. Meanwhile, villagers unwilling to leave Galar found Sylveroy and healed him unaware that he was the true king of these lands. A few months later, the little pokemon to thank its saviors offered them fertile land. The happy villagers began to venerate him and understood that he was the true king of these places. At the same time, the two kings accompanied by their people found Unys and decided to settle there. These lands were not inhabited by men but a strong energy floated in the air. By dint of exploration, men ended up finding the origin of this energy, the dragon of harmony. While some wanted to cohabit with him or others wanted to try to eliminate him, the two kings made the decision to try to ally with the dragon. Against all odds they succeeded and Unys began its development. But the two kings did not have the same vision of things as to how to govern their kingdom. While AZ had a rather realistic vision, Harmonia had a very idealistic vision and what started with a small disagreement between the two brothers ended in a real civil war. The dragon not knowing who to defend, flew away and in a cry of despair split. Three creatures were born then, Reshiram, the dragon of reality, Zekrom the dragon of the ideal and Kyurem the border between the two. Reshiram and Zekrom each joined their king while Kyurem went to hide in the mountain. The power of Reshiram and Zekrom was such that the fight between the two brothers ravaged Unova. When the two brothers realized this, they made peace and AZ left with his followers leaving Reshiram in the care of his brother. But the sission of the dragon had an equally important impact on the ecosystem. Because of its power, it alone governed the entire ecosystem of the region. At the time of its disappearance, nature had to regulate itself. It was then that three geniuses were born, Boreas, Fulguris and Demeteros. Boreas was breaking storms and Fulguris caused violent storms but they caused as much damage as benefit for the ecosystem this is where Demeteros intervenes to correct his colleagues and thus bring the necessary energy to the fauna and flora to develop. Three other entities were also born at the same time, Viridium, Terrakium and Colbatium. Their goal was to protect pokemon even if it means attacking humans they consider dangerous.</p>

This is how they arrived in Kalos, a land ravaged by conflicts between the different groups that inhabit it. After a few years, AZ managed to unify the peoples of Kalos which earned him the title of king. Kalos also made enormous technological progress thanks to the Wishing Stars, pieces of Ethernatos, brought back from Galar by AZ. Harmonia jealous of the prosperity of his brother's country while his own struggled to recover from the siscion of the dragon, he decided to go to war against Kalos. In order to counter Unova's attacks, all Pokémon were mobilized. This is how Floette, the faithful companion that AZ had met on arriving in Kalos, left for the front. Some time later, we came to give a box to the King of Kalos. Inside, the lifeless body of his faithful companion who died in battle. Mad with grief and unable to accept the death of his pokemon, AZ set out to bring it back to life by all means. He then builds a machine capable of bringing his Floette back to life and making him immortal. While AZ's grief was appeased, her anger was not. He then transformed his machine into an ultimate weapon and used it to annihilate those who had dared to harm his companion. Faced with this spectacle of death, Floette decided to leave AZ, no longer recognizing him. AZ devastated by the loss of his companion for the second time and having also been made immortal following too much exposure to the energy of his machine, he abandoned his position as king taking with him the key to his weapon so that no one uses it anymore and went wandering the world in search of their pokemon. Harmonia having survived this war decided to bury her brother's weapon and erased all traces of him before returning to reign on Unys until his death.</p>

Like their elders, the two brothers with divergent ideas ended up in conflict and a new civil war broke out in Unova. The conflict stretches over several years and ravages the fauna and flora without any victor in sight. It was then that Celebi, a fabulous pokemon capable of time travel, decided to seek out a hero from another era capable of ending the conflict. This is how Celebi returned with Julie, a trainer from the future who wanted a new challenge for her training. Sure of her victory, the young trainer challenged the two kings to a duel at the same time in a 2 pokemon against 2 pokemon fight. At the end of an incredible fight, Julie managed to overcome the two legendary dragons thanks to a form of evolution unknown until then, the Mega-Evolution, which she applied to her Carchacrock. This defeat made the two kings realize that their conflict had ravaged the region. They wanted to redeem themselves but were afraid that a new conflict would break out and the strength of their dragon would once again ravage the region. It was then that AZ appeared and offered to seal the dragons in stone. The kings were against it but Julie who surprisingly seemed to know the former king of Kalos convinced them to trust her. This is how Reshiram became the white pebble and Zekrom the black pebble. Julie then returned to her time and the two young kings took on the daunting task of rebuilding Unova together.</p>

Indeed, the ground of Hoenn had fractured under the impact, and the energy of nature which bubbled underground rose to the surface... waking Primo-Groudon and Primo-Kyogre! Humanity had not forgotten what had happened millennia earlier... The providential appearance of a legendary sparkling green Pokémon... It was then that the meteorite which had crashed in Atalanopolis began to emit a gleam... Again, Rayquaza descended from the heavens... As the men multiplied the marks of devotion towards him, a change occurred. Rayquaza was shrouded in blinding light... When he reappeared, he looked completely different and exuded an even more intense aura and power than before. Rayquaza had changed under the effect of the iridescent stone and the prayers of men to become Mega-Rayquaza. He again came between Primo-Groudon and Primo-Kyogre. He covered the sky with his golden barbels... His body sparkled with a virid brilliance... and a stormy wind began to blow. Light and wind absorbed the strength of Primo-Groudon and Primo-Kyogre in a flash. Having lost their primitive form, the two Pokémon disappeared, in the depths of the earth for one, in the depths of the sea for the other. Satisfied, Rayquaza reverted to his original form and rose up into the sky again. Having witnessed the scene, AZ would have pronounced these words: “The symbol Δ (delta) accompanies great upheavals. But together, men, prayers and stone were able to appease this troubled world. He also planted a seed at the place of confrontation. This seed will later become the gigantic tree in front of the Origin Cave. The People of Meteor built a huge tower in honor of Rayquaza and the iridescent stone from which he drew his strength.</p>
