        <p class="Intro">Sinnoh Adventure :</p>
        <p class="body_txt">Lou is a young child from Sinnoh raised by Professor Sorbier. At the age of 7, the young Lou decides to go on a trip to discover the world. Professor Sorbier then entrusted him with a Tortipouss as well as an Eevee that his mother had bequeathed to him before entrusting Lou to Sorbier. This is how our hero's long journey began. It wasn't long before he caught his first Pokemon, a Roocool that got caught in a storm and hovered over Littorella. He then captured a Lixy shortly afterwards, and found a Caninos that had been abandoned before arriving at Féli-Cité. Once in town he met Professor Chen who entrusted him with a Charmander. He then left for Charbourg to obtain his first badge. He found a water stone in the mines of the city, evolved his Eevee into Aquali and made a name for himself by crushing the champion of the city with this unique Pokemon at only 7 years old. He then headed for Floraville. There he had a first altercation with Team Galaxy. After a fierce battle, he narrowly lost to Commander Mars and several of his henchmen. He managed to flee thanks to his Pokemon but his Caninos was stolen by Team Galaxy. Determined to recover his Pokemon Lou trained tirelessly for several weeks. His Roocool evolved into Roocoups, his Lixy into Luxio, his Charmander into Reptincel and finally his Tortipouss into Boskara then into Torterra. He then found Team Galaxy took revenge. However, he could not recover his Caninos which had been sent to HQ. He then made the decision to do everything possible to recover his Pokemon ! Intensive training then followed, the first part in the forest of Vestigion, then, once arrived at Vestigion, our hero took the path of Mont Courronné and headed for the snowy roads north of it. There his Reptincel evolved into Charizard and his Roucoops into Roucarnage. During his training he met Flo the champion of Vestigion and made the decision to return to Vestigion to test his level. The level difference was such between the two trainers that Flo's 6 Pokemon were defeated by Lou's Pidgeot without even being able to touch it. He also took advantage of the presence of a Galaxy building in the city to attack them and rout the commander there. He found a Kraknoix stolen by Team Galaxy in the building and decided to make it his new companion before heading south towards Uniopolis. Arriving in Uniopolis, Lou encountered Aaron, a member of Council 4 and challenged him to a duel. Lou managed to win the fight and even if Aaron hadn't given his all he was impressed by the talent of the young trainer. Following this fight Lou continued on his way to the arena and after an epic confrontation managed to obtain a third badge. During this fight Kraknoix evolved into Vibraninf. They then set course for Voilaroc, the city in which the HQ of Team Galaxy is located. Once there, Lou stormed the HQ and eventually reached Hélio, the boss of Team Galaxy. At the end of a crazy confrontation Hélio ends up winning the duel. Seeing the potential of the young trainer Hélio decided to give him back his Caninos and offered him to join Team Galaxy. Happy to have recovered his Pokemon and admiring the strength and charisma of the leader of Team Galaxy, Lou hesitated before leaving the building, saying that he was going to think about the proposal. He then earned his fourth badge following a confrontation against the champion of Voilaroc during which his Vibraninf evolved into Libégon. He then took the direction of Verchamps by leaving custody of his Caninos to Professor Sorbier. Faced Lovis the champion of the city and at the end of a tight fight ended up winning thanks to his Libégon. He then befriended a Mustéflott and decided to integrate her into his team by sending Aquali to Professor Sorbier as well.</p>
